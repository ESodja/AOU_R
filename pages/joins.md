# Joining data
Joins between datatypes are usually required to attach different types of data for the same individuals in a cohort together.
Each data type is likely to have different individuals in them, so the choice has to be made whether to include all of one or the other dataset, and leave the "extra" blank spots or not.
This depends on your goals.
For example, if you are comparing survey responses to whether someone has a given diagnosed condition, you may want to keep only individuals that have useful survey responses, but there will probably be indiviudals in your cohort that do not have a given condition (unless you chose your cohort specifically as individuals with that condition).
In that case, you would need to answer the questions in the console interface as [fill in answers once that part is done].
